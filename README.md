# 🎯 Camerounian Tontine Management System

**A Camerounian tontine** is a traditional financial system where members meet—usually once a week—to contribute a fixed amount of money. This amount, agreed upon at the beginning of each cycle, is collected and given to one member who uses it to fund a personal project. The following week, another member receives the contribution, and the rotation continues until everyone has received their share.
A tontine functions like an association with an elected or appointed executive committee responsible for ensuring smooth organization and transparency. Each meeting begins with a review of the previous session’s events, followed by the agenda for the current meeting. At the end, once the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) has received the collected funds, the members share a meal and drinks as part of a communal celebration.
**This application aims to digitize the entire tontine process**, from the creation of the group to the management of meetings, contributions, beneficiaries, and reports, ensuring a modern, transparent, and efficient experience for all participants.
